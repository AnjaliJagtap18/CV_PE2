|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Practical 1   | Geometric transformations of an image                     |
| Practical 2   | Texture feature extraction using GLCM / Gabor transform   |
| Practical 3   | Morphological operations                                  |
| Practical 4   | Chain coding and decoding                                 |

## **Environment**  
This course will primarily be carried out in the **Google Colab** or **VSCode** environment. Ensure the following setup is ready on your local machine:

### **Prerequisites**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **Python 3.x** (preferably the latest version)  
- **VSCode** (Visual Studio Code)  

### **Required Libraries**  
Install the following libraries using `pip`:  
- **OpenCV (cv2):** For computer vision tasks  
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib:** For plotting and visualizations  
- **scikit-image:** For image processing tasks  
- **scikit-learn:** For machine learning tasks  
- **Pillow:** For general image handling
