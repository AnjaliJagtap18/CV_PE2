Practicals
The practicals covered in this course are summarized below:

Practical	Description
Practical 1	Geometric transformations of an image
Practical 2	Texture feature extraction using GLCM / Gabor transform
Practical 3	Morphological operations
Practical 4	Chain coding and decoding
Practical 5	Image registration
Practical 6	Face recognition using Viola-Jones algorithm or similar application
Practical 7	Disparity estimation / Depth map generation
Practical 8	3D modeling
Each practical will have its own Colab notebook, and links to them will be provided once they are completed.

Projects
Project	Description
Project 1	Example (tbd)
Project 2	Example (tbd)
Projects will be implemented and documented in Colab notebooks.

Environment
This course will be primarily carried out in the Google Colab or VSCode environment. Ensure you have the following setup on your local machine:

Prerequisites
Google Colab
Python 3.x (preferably the latest version)
VSCode (Visual Studio Code)
Required Libraries
Install the following libraries using pip:

OpenCV (cv2): For computer vision tasks.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizations.
scikit-image: For image processing tasks.
scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks.
Pillow: For general image handling.
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-image scikit-learn Pillow
